# Image_Recognition-Using-CNN
This project focuses on implementing an image recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used for this project includes various images that serve as input for training and testing the CNN model. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of classifying these images correctly.
